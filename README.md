## üöÄ Features

- **Prediction using Random Forest Classifier**: Utilizes historical stock data to make predictions.
- **Input Stock Ticker**: Accepts stock tickers (from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)) as input for predictions.
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Easy-to-Run Main Script**: Simply run the main file and follow the prompts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries and Dependencies

The project leverages the following Python libraries:
- `sklearn`: For the Random Forest Classifier and evaluation metrics.
- `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `yfinance`: To fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The project consists of three main Python files:

- **`main.py`:** Entry point, handles user interaction, and calls functions from other modules.
- **`ml.py`:** Implements the Random Forest model for prediction.
- **`data.py`:** Handles data retrieval, preprocessing, and price-related operations using yfinance.
